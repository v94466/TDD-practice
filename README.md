## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your PC
2. Go into the project's root directory, and run the command 'npm install'.
3. Run the test suite using the command 'npm test'.

If the Command 'npm test' does not work, you may need to install mocha globally on your machine. Do this with command 'npm install -g mocha'.
